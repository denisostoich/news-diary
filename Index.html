                Bitcoin dropped below $60,000 on Sunday after new all-time highs, but stablecoin inflows show
                <br>this is not a big concern.

                <br>that the uptrend is likely to continue in the near term.
            </p>
            <p>
                One key metric that is signaling an optimistic short-term trend for Bitcoin is the rise in
                <br>stablecoin deposits into exchanges.

                Why Bitcoin dropped after $60K breach
            </h2>
            <p>
                When Bitcoin enters price discovery and hits a new record-high, the interest in the
                <br>market naturally spikes.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a lot of liquidity in the current red-hot market, making it an ideal period for
                <br>whales and high-net-worth investors to take profit on their positions.

                Filbfilb, a pseudonymous trader and technical analyst, noted that high futures market
                <br>funding rates and Bitcoin deposits into exchanges were spotted before the drop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bitcoin futures market uses a mechanism called "funding" to incentivize traders
                <br>based on the balance of the market.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if there are more buyers or long contract holders in the Bitcoin futures
                <br>market, short-sellers are incentivized to sell or short. When this happens, the funding
                <br>rate increases, making it expensive for traders to long Bitcoin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the drop, the futures funding rate of BTC was hovering in the 0.05% to 0.1%
                <br>range, which is five to ten times higher than the default 0.01% funding rate. Filbfilb

                    "Bitcoin temporary selloff after high funding, big net BTC
                    <br>and weekend pump. Guess people thought it was
                    <br>different this time."

            <p>
                High Bitcoin inflows into exchanges likely fueled the drop because whales often
                <br>deposit BTC into exchanges when they intend to sell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the combination of the selling pressure coming from whales and the high
                <br>futures funding rate was the likely reason behind today's pullback.

                How stablecoin inflows can further fuel the BTC
                <br>rally
            </h2>
            <p>
                But despite, the halt in the rally, stablecoin inflows into exchanges are rising once
                <br>again, according to the latest data from
                <a href="http://cryptoquant.com/">

                In the crypto market, traders often hedge their holdings against stablecoins like Tether
                <br>(USDT) and USDC, rather than cashing out via withdrawals to bank accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, exchanges have a three to seven-day processing period for cash deposits,
                <br>and when traders want to re-enter the cryptocurrency market, moving cash from their
                <br>bank accounts back to exchanges becomes cumbersome.

                Hence, when stablecoins begin to flow into exchanges again — as seen by the green
                <br>spikes in the chart above — it suggests that sidelined capital may be looking to get
                <br>back into Bitcoin.

                Throughout the past week, the one missing component during the Bitcoin rally was
                <br>stablecoin inflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Bitcoin rallies without a noticeable rise in stablecoin inflows, it increases the
                <br>probability of an unsustainable uptrend and a short-term correction.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the trend of sidelined capital moving back into the crypto market continues, there is
                <br>a high probability that this will further fuel Bitcoin's momentum resulting in a broader
                <br>rally.
